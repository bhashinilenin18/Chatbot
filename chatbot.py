    "NLP_BASICS": {
        "name": "NLP Basics",
        "explanation": "NLP basics involve transforming human language into data that computers can understand and process. This includes tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.",
        "task": "Explain how NLP helps computers understand text and speech.",
        "answer": "NLP techniques like tokenization and lemmatization help break down and understand text structure and meaning.",
        "explanation_answer": "NLP enables computers to process text by breaking it down into manageable parts (like tokens) and finding the base meaning (like with lemmatization)."
    },
    "TOKENIZATION": {
        "name": "Tokenization",
        "explanation": "Tokenization splits text into individual words or phrases, allowing for better analysis and manipulation of text.",
        "task": "Please tokenize this sentence: 'Text analysis splits text into manageable parts.'",
        "answer": ["Text", "analysis", "splits", "text", "into", "manageable", "parts"],
        "explanation_answer": "Tokenization splits the sentence into individual words or tokens, helping us analyze each component."
    },
    "STEMMING": {
        "name": "Stemming",
        "explanation": "Stemming reduces words to their root form. For example, 'running' becomes 'run'. This helps with matching words to their base meaning.",
        "task": "What is the stem of 'running' and 'happily'?",
        "answer": ["run", "happili"],
        "explanation_answer": "Stemming reduces words to their base form by removing suffixes. 'Running' becomes 'run', and 'happily' becomes 'happili'."
    },
    "LEMMATIZATION": {
        "name": "Lemmatization",
        "explanation": "Lemmatization reduces words to their dictionary form. Unlike stemming, it returns valid words (e.g., 'better' -> 'good').",
        "task": "What is the lemmatized form of 'better' and 'children'?",
        "answer": ["good", "child"],
        "explanation_answer": "Lemmatization finds the dictionary form of words: 'better' becomes 'good' and 'children' becomes 'child'."
    },
    "SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS": {
        "name": "Sentiment Analysis",
        "explanation": "Sentiment Analysis determines the sentiment behind text, such as positive, negative, or neutral tones, often used in customer feedback and reviews.",
        "task": "Analyze the sentiment of: 'This product is amazing!'",
        "answer": "Positive",
        "explanation_answer": "The phrase contains positive words ('amazing') indicating a positive sentiment."
    },
    "SPEECH_RECOGNITION": {
        "name": "Speech Recognition",
        "explanation": "Speech Recognition converts spoken language into text, enabling voice-activated applications.",
        "task": "Describe an example of where speech recognition is used in daily life.",
        "answer": "Virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa",
        "explanation_answer": "Speech recognition powers virtual assistants like Siri, which convert spoken commands into text to execute actions."

        "Remember to take deep breaths. It's okay to take breaks and come back when you're ready."
    ],
    "FRUSTRATION": [
        "Frustration is part of the learning process. Let's review the basics if it feels too hard.",
